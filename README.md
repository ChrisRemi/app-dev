**Avengers Endgame is one of my favorite movies that i watch, watching marvel movies is fun**

**short information about the movie from common sense media:**

**AVENGERS: ENDGAME is set after Thanos' catastrophic use of the Infinity Stones randomly wiped out half of Earth's population in Avengers: Infinity War. Those left behind are desperate to do something -- anything -- to bring back their lost loved ones. But after an initial attempt -- with extra help from Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) -- creates more problems than solutions, the grieving, purposeless Avengers think all hope is lost. 

They're reenergized by the eventual reappearance of Scott Lang, aka Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), who was stuck in the quantum realm during the fight on Wakanda. He believes there could be a way to reverse Thanos' deadly snap. It takes a while to gather the squad -- some of whom have changed dramatically -- but eventually Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Rocket (Bradley Cooper), Nebula (Karen Gillan), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), and Ant-Man team up for one last life-or-death mission to outsmart Thanos (Josh Brolin) and save the universe.**
